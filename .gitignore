# ========== Gitignore for Godot Engine 4+ Projects =======================
# =========================================================================
# This file tells Git which files and directories it should ignore.

/Builds/

# or due to specific addons/workflows, although less common now.
# .import/

# Mono/C# specific (if using C#)

# === Optional: Asset Library ===
# If you download assets via the Godot Asset Library, they often go here.
# Decide if you want to commit downloaded assets or require collaborators
# to download them separately. If you don't commit them, ignore this:
# addons/ # Be careful: Only ignore if ALL addons are from AssetLib/external.
          # If you develop your own addons IN this folder, DO NOT ignore it.
.godot/imported/ # Asset library extracted files (often handled by .godot/ anyway)
